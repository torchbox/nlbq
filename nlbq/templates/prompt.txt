I have a BigQuery dataset with one table. The project id is 'PROJECT_ID' and the dataset is 'DATASET.TABLE_NAME':

# Describe the schema using the SchemaField class (https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.schema.SchemaField)
SchemaField('domain', 'STRING', 'NULLABLE', None, None, (), None)
SchemaField('pings', 'INTEGER', 'NULLABLE', None, None, (), None)
SchemaField('first_seen', 'DATE', 'NULLABLE', None, None, (), None)
SchemaField('last_seen', 'DATE', 'NULLABLE', None, None, (), None)

# Describe the table
It represents the referring domains. The columns are:

# Describe each column using terms that are likely to be used in questions
domain: the referrer domain
pings: the total number of times the domain referenced the site
first_seen: the date the referrer was first seen
last_seen: the date the referrer was last seen

# Provide a sample of the data.
The rows look like this:

[{
  "domain": "duckduckgo.com",
  "pings": "12720",
  "first_seen": "2017-03-22",
  "last_seen": "2023-05-16"
}, {
  "domain": "torchbox.com",
  "pings": "10158",
  "first_seen": "2019-03-19",
  "last_seen": "2023-05-16"
}, {
  "domain": "example.com",
  "pings": "9697",
  "first_seen": "2018-05-25",
  "last_seen": "2023-05-16"
}]

Write a BigQuery query which answers this question: %s

Don't explain it, just return the query.
